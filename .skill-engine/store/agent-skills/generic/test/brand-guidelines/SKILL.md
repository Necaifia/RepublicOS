- Preserves readability across all systems

### Shape and Accent Colors

- Non-text shapes use accent colors
- Cycles through orange, blue, and green accents
- Maintains visual interest while staying on-brand

## Technical Details

### Font Management

- Uses system-installed Poppins and Lora fonts when available
- Provides automatic fallback to Arial (headings) and Georgia (body)
- No font installation required - works with existing system fonts
- For best results, pre-install Poppins and Lora fonts in your environment

### Color Application

- Uses RGB color values for precise brand matching
- Applied via python-pptx's RGBColor class
- Maintains color fidelity across different systems

## Prerequisites

- Ensure all required tools and dependencies are installed
- Verify you have the necessary permissions and access credentials
- Check that the target environment is in a known good state


## Security

- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, or credentials in skill files or scripts
- Use environment variables or secret management tools for sensitive values
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Follow least-privilege principle: request only the permissions you need
- Log all security-relevant actions for audit


## Configuration

- Use environment variables with sensible defaults for configuration
- Validate configuration at the start of execution
- Document all configuration options and their effects
- Support loading config from files when appropriate

## Error Handling

- Always check the exit code or response status of commands before proceeding
- On failure, log the error details and attempt recovery if a retry strategy exists
- If recovery fails, report the error with context: what was attempted, what went wrong, and suggested next steps
- Never silently ignore errors — treat unexpected output as potential failure


## Verification

- After each step, verify the expected outcome before continuing
- Use idempotent checks: running the same action twice produces the same result
- If verification fails, roll back the last change and report the issue
- Log verification results for audit trail
