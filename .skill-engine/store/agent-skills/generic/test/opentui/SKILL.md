# OpenTUI Platform Skill

Consolidated skill for building terminal user interfaces with OpenTUI. Use decision trees below to find the right framework and components, then load detailed references.

## Critical Rules

**Follow these rules in all OpenTUI code:**

1. **Use `create-tui` for new projects.** See framework `REFERENCE.md` quick starts.
2. **`create-tui` options must come before arguments.** `bunx create-tui -t react my-app` works, `bunx create-tui my-app -t react` does NOT.
3. **Never call `process.exit()` directly.** Use `renderer.destroy()` (see `core/gotchas.md`).
4. **Text styling requires nested tags in React/Solid.** Use modifier elements, not props (see `components/text-display.md`).

## How to Use This Skill

### Reference File Structure

Framework references follow a 5-file pattern. Cross-cutting concepts are single-file guides.

Each framework in `./references/<framework>/` contains:

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `REFERENCE.md` | Overview, when to use, quick start | **Always read first** |
| `api.md` | Runtime API, components, hooks | Writing code |
| `configuration.md` | Setup, tsconfig, bundling | Configuring a project |
| `patterns.md` | Common patterns, best practices | Implementation guidance |
| `gotchas.md` | Pitfalls, limitations, debugging | Troubleshooting |

Cross-cutting concepts in `./references/<concept>/` have `REFERENCE.md` as the entry point.

### Reading Order

1. Start with `REFERENCE.md` for your chosen framework
2. Then read additional files relevant to your task:
   - Building components -> `api.md` + `components/<category>.md`
   - Setting up project -> `configuration.md`
   - Layout/positioning -> `layout/REFERENCE.md`
   - Keyboard/input handling -> `keyboard/REFERENCE.md`
   - Animations -> `animation/REFERENCE.md`
   - Troubleshooting -> `gotchas.md` + `testing/REFERENCE.md`

### Example Paths

```
./references/react/REFERENCE.md           # Start here for React
./references/react/api.md              # React components and hooks
./references/solid/configuration.md    # Solid project setup
./references/components/inputs.md      # Input, Textarea, Select docs
./references/core/gotchas.md           # Core debugging tips
```

### Runtime Notes

OpenTUI runs on Bun and uses Zig for native builds. Read `./references/core/gotchas.md` for runtime requirements and build guidance.

## Quick Decision Trees

### "Which framework should I use?"

```
Which framework?
├─ I want full control, maximum performance, no framework overhead
│  └─ core/ (imperative API)
├─ I know React, want familiar component patterns
│  └─ react/ (React reconciler)
├─ I want fine-grained reactivity, optimal re-renders
│  └─ solid/ (Solid reconciler)
└─ I'm building a library/framework on top of OpenTUI
   └─ core/ (imperative API)
```

### "I need to display content"

```
Display content?
├─ Plain or styled text -> components/text-display.md
├─ Container with borders/background -> components/containers.md
├─ Scrollable content area -> components/containers.md (scrollbox)
├─ ASCII art banner/title -> components/text-display.md (ascii-font)
├─ Data table with borders/wrapping -> components/code-diff.md (TextTable)
├─ Code with syntax highlighting -> components/code-diff.md
├─ Diff viewer (unified/split) -> components/code-diff.md
├─ Line numbers with diagnostics -> components/code-diff.md
└─ Markdown content (streaming) -> components/code-diff.md (markdown)
```

### "I need user input"

```
User input?
├─ Single-line text field -> components/inputs.md (input)
├─ Multi-line text editor -> components/inputs.md (textarea)
├─ Select from a list (vertical) -> components/inputs.md (select)
├─ Tab-based selection (horizontal) -> components/inputs.md (tab-select)
└─ Custom keyboard shortcuts -> keyboard/REFERENCE.md
```

### "I need layout/positioning"

```
Layout?
├─ Flexbox-style layouts (row, column, wrap) -> layout/REFERENCE.md
├─ Absolute positioning -> layout/patterns.md
├─ Responsive to terminal size -> layout/patterns.md
├─ Centering content -> layout/patterns.md
└─ Complex nested layouts -> layout/patterns.md
```

### "I need animations"

```
Animations?
├─ Timeline-based animations -> animation/REFERENCE.md
├─ Easing functions -> animation/REFERENCE.md
├─ Property transitions -> animation/REFERENCE.md
└─ Looping animations -> animation/REFERENCE.md
```

### "I need to handle input"

```
Input handling?
├─ Keyboard events (keypress, release) -> keyboard/REFERENCE.md
├─ Focus management -> keyboard/REFERENCE.md
├─ Paste events -> keyboard/REFERENCE.md
├─ Mouse events -> components/containers.md
├─ Text selection & copy-on-select -> keyboard/REFERENCE.md (selection)
└─ Clipboard (OSC 52) -> keyboard/REFERENCE.md (clipboard)
```

### "I need to test my TUI"

```
Testing?
├─ Snapshot testing -> testing/REFERENCE.md
├─ Interaction testing -> testing/REFERENCE.md
├─ Test renderer setup -> testing/REFERENCE.md
└─ Debugging tests -> testing/REFERENCE.md
```

### "I need to debug/troubleshoot"

```
Troubleshooting?
├─ Runtime errors, crashes -> <framework>/gotchas.md
├─ Layout issues -> layout/REFERENCE.md + layout/patterns.md
├─ Input/focus issues -> keyboard/REFERENCE.md
└─ Repro + regression tests -> testing/REFERENCE.md
```

### Troubleshooting Index

- Terminal cleanup, crashes -> `core/gotchas.md`
- Text styling not applying -> `components/text-display.md`
- Input focus/shortcuts -> `keyboard/REFERENCE.md`
- Layout misalignment -> `layout/REFERENCE.md`
- Flaky snapshots -> `testing/REFERENCE.md`

For component naming differences and text modifiers, see `components/REFERENCE.md`.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure all required tools and dependencies are installed
- Verify you have the necessary permissions and access credentials
- Check that the target environment is in a known good state


## Error Handling

- Always check the exit code or response status of commands before proceeding
- On failure, log the error details and attempt recovery if a retry strategy exists
- If recovery fails, report the error with context: what was attempted, what went wrong, and suggested next steps
- Never silently ignore errors — treat unexpected output as potential failure


## Verification

- After each step, verify the expected outcome before continuing
- Use idempotent checks: running the same action twice produces the same result
- If verification fails, roll back the last change and report the issue
- Log verification results for audit trail


## Configuration

- Use environment variables with sensible defaults for configuration
- Validate configuration at the start of execution
- Document all configuration options and their effects
- Support loading config from files when appropriate
