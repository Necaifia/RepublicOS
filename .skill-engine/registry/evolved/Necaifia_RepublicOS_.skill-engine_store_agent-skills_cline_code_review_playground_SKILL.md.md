description: Creates interactive HTML playgrounds — self-contained single-file explorers
  that let users configure something visually through controls, see a live preview,
  and copy out a prompt. Use when the user asks to make a playground, explorer, or
  interactive tool for a topic. Applies structured code review with automated linting,
  security scanning, and quality gates. Uses AI-native test strategy with self-healing,
  intent-based authoring, and PR-time verification gates.

# Playground Builder

A playground is a self-contained HTML file with interactive controls on one side, a live preview on the other, and a prompt output at the bottom with a copy button. The user adjusts controls, explores visually, then copies the generated prompt back into their agent.

## When to use this skill

When the user asks for an interactive playground, explorer, or visual tool for a topic — especially when the input space is large, visual, or structural and hard to express as plain text.

## How to use this skill

1. **Identify the playground type** from the user's request
2. **Load the matching template** from `templates/`:
   - `templates/design-playground.md` — Visual design decisions (components, layouts, spacing, color, typography)
   - `templates/data-explorer.md` — Data and query building (SQL, APIs, pipelines, regex)
   - `templates/concept-map.md` — Learning and exploration (concept maps, knowledge gaps, scope mapping)
   - `templates/document-critique.md` — Document review (suggestions with approve/reject/comment workflow)
   - `templates/diff-review.md` — Code review (git diffs, commits, PRs with line-by-line commenting)
   - `templates/code-map.md` — Codebase architecture (component relationships, data flow, layer diagrams)
3. **Follow the template** to build the playground. If the topic doesn't fit any template cleanly, use the one closest and adapt.
4. **Open in browser when available.** After writing the HTML file, launch it in the user's default browser if the environment supports that; otherwise provide the file path.

## Core requirements (every playground)

- **Single HTML file.** Inline all CSS and JS. No external dependencies.
- **Live preview.** Updates instantly on every control change. No "Apply" button.
- **Prompt output.** Natural language, not a value dump. Only mentions non-default choices. Includes enough context to act on without seeing the playground. Updates live.
- **Copy button.** Clipboard copy with brief "Copied!" feedback.
- **Sensible defaults + presets.** Looks good on first load. Include 3-5 named presets that snap all controls to a cohesive combination.
- **Dark theme.** System font for UI, monospace for code/values. Minimal chrome.

## State management pattern

Keep a single state object. Every control writes to it, every render reads from it.

```javascript
const state = { /* all configurable values */ };

function updateAll() {
  renderPreview(); // update the visual
  updatePrompt();  // rebuild the prompt text
}
// Every control calls updateAll() on change
```

## Prompt output pattern

```javascript
function updatePrompt() {
  const parts = [];

  // Only mention non-default values
  if (state.borderRadius !== DEFAULTS.borderRadius) {
    parts.push(`border-radius of ${state.borderRadius}px`);
  }

  // Use qualitative language alongside numbers
  if (state.shadowBlur > 16) parts.push('a pronounced shadow');
  else if (state.shadowBlur > 0) parts.push('a subtle shadow');

  prompt.textContent = `Update the card to use ${parts.join(', ')}.`;
}
```

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Prompt output is just a value dump → write it as a natural instruction
- Too many controls at once → group by concern, hide advanced in a collapsible section
- Preview doesn't update instantly → every control change must trigger immediate re-render
- No defaults or presets → starts empty or broken on load
- External dependencies → if CDN is down, playground is dead
- Prompt lacks context → include enough that it's actionable without the playground

## Prerequisites

- Ensure all required tools and dependencies are installed
- Verify you have the necessary permissions and access credentials
- Check that the target environment is in a known good state


## Security

- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, or credentials in skill files or scripts
- Use environment variables or secret management tools for sensitive values
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Follow least-privilege principle: request only the permissions you need
- Log all security-relevant actions for audit


## Configuration

- Use environment variables with sensible defaults for configuration
- Validate configuration at the start of execution
- Document all configuration options and their effects
- Support loading config from files when appropriate

## Error Handling

- Always check the exit code or response status of commands before proceeding
- On failure, log the error details and attempt recovery if a retry strategy exists
- If recovery fails, report the error with context: what was attempted, what went wrong, and suggested next steps
- Never silently ignore errors — treat unexpected output as potential failure


## Verification

- After each step, verify the expected outcome before continuing
- Use idempotent checks: running the same action twice produces the same result
- If verification fails, roll back the last change and report the issue
- Log verification results for audit trail
